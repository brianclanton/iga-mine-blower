Background Music for Mine Blower
Jim Arnold & Brian Clanton

So, for our project we are trying to be sort of procedural
with our background music. When the torpedo is fired, the music
will go to a kind of suspenseful chord and then either resolve
to a deceptive cadence if the torpedo misses and an authentic 
cadence if it hits. As a result, or background music will
repeatedly play a simple main riff over and over until a torpedo 
is fired. At that time it will switch to the suspensful riff at 
the end of the current measure. When the torpedo hits or is 
determined to have missed, the resulting hit or miss riff will
then be played immediately and that will move back into the main 
riff. We are still thinking about what to do when you're out of 
torpedos, but we'll get to that.
